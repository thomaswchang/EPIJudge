    Key Point:
        Fast access for element at an index; slow lookups unless sorted. Be comfortable with iterations, resizing, partitioning, and merging

    Arrays are represented by python lists [].  Consecutive elements are represented by continuous memory, giving it its efficiency characteristics.

    Efficiency
        - Arrays operate efficiently from both ends
        - Brute force solutions with array requires O(n) space; but one can use array itself to reduce space complexity to O(1)
        - Adding arrays from front is slow; see if one can add arrays from the back
        - Instead of deleting, which may cause moving all entries to the right, consider over-writing an element

    Others
        - Be careful for off by 1 errors, reading past the last element of an array
        - Be comfortable writing code that operates on subarrays

        * Hash table is optimized (O(1)) for key lookups; In comparison, BST gives O(log(n)) for min/max element, key lookup, delete, find

    - Pointers
        * One can iterate through elements in sorted order in O(N) regardless whether BST is balanced
        * Combine BST with hash table. One of the most common mistake for BST is not updating the element.
            Ex: Student(name, GPA).  BST node is Student; tree is ordered by gpa. If we need to update a student score by name, we need to traverse entire tree since we BST gaurantees n.gpa > node.left.gpa. By having a hashtable, we can look up a node by student name, DELETE the node, and update.
        * Consider augmenting the node.data to be more complex to support complex queries (Page 220)

    - Recursion is GENERAL approach of decomposing a problem in sub problems. Good approach to problems like search, enumeration, and divideConquer.

    - Relationship to divide&Conquer, DP, and regular expression.

        * Divide & Conquer: sub problems are (i) INDEPENDENT (ii) of same type (? same input parameter)

        * Dynamic Programming: sub problems are (i) DEPENDENT (ii) of the same type
            dependent means the solution of 1 subProblemA depends on solution of subProblemB.
            It could also mean we pass the function with the sample input values; in this case we should cache the result

        * Regular Expression: sub problems are of different type (?)

    - Recursive function consists of
        * base termination
        * define input parameters where at each recursion call we pass in different values.

    - Recursion call implemented via a function takes space complexity; rewrite via iteration to save this

    - Recursion can be removed from tail-recursive by using a while loop IF we frame the recursive function from A to this; this is what compilers do.

          if n == 0: return 1

          if n == 0: return 1
          else: return tail_factorial(n-1, accumulator * n) <- compiler now does not need to track the multiplication result; compiler can rewrite this with while.  UNFORTUNATELY, python does not do this.

    - Problems
        * If I know how to move the n-1 solution, how does it help with the nth solution? This can help model the recurrence relationship. [HANOI]
        * recursion often gives rise to brute-force non-efficient run time. Minimize by cache or smarter way of iterating (N-QUEENS: iterate by rows)
        * Be efficient with storage; try to reuse state variables, rewrite/reuse at each recursive function. [N-QUEENS: P15.3 col_placment]
        * Recursion will often use back-tracking for generating permutation problems. (Generate the Power Set P15.4 pg 231)
        * To calculate time complexity: O(n) often depends on the number of recursive calls, C(n), for each function. (see permutation.py and power_set.py), usually n! or 2^n

    DP is an algorithm
        - express a solution recursively in terms of previous sub solutions
        - applicable to problems like: optimization, combinations, and decision problems

    In relation to Divide&Conquer
        - Both combines solutions of smaller sub-problems. Both combines optimum solutions to subproblem to arrive at a global optimum (unlike greedy)
        - Unlike Divide&Conquer, DP sub-problem can appear over and over, (ie the same input argument). DP takes advantage of this pattern by
            (i) caching sub-problems solutions. We cache the result in a hash or a BST.
            (ii) iterate in a bottom up approach
        - Unlike Divide&Conquer, we are not dividing the problem to 2 EQUAL halves, such as quicksort

    In relation to recursion
        - Both uses recursion: identify the recurrence relationship and model it
        - However, recursion can be both SPACE and COMPUTATION inefficient.
            (i) Call stacks --> space.
            (ii) Repeating the same call with the same argument -> wasted computation.
            DP addresses (ii) by caching the result of the sub problem.  Caching will take some space though.

    To apply DP,
        (i) frame the original problem in such a way tha solving the sub problems can be used solve the original problem
            Because of this, one may need to think back from the solution. Ex: Find maximum sum sub array: find max contiguous sum
            SUPPOSE we look at the sub solution at index i. What are prior sub solutions at i-1?  What are the possible states that solution i can use?  Ans: either we use the solution at i-1 OR we start over.

        (ii) cache the solution to the sub-problem

    Leetcode notes on GoogleDrive

    Step1: How to recognize a problem is a DP? What is the recurrence?
        At this point, you work out an example, using the variables in problem, but not formalizing the state.  We have not formalized the recurrence in function form, but in example form
            Ex: diceTargetSum:
                Variables: dices, values, target
                Let assume we have 5 dices, each with 6 values
        Property1: Overlapping subproblems
            Solution to a sub-problem is used over and over.  Binary search can use recursion, but we do not reuse solutions.
            Applied to memoization (top down)
            similar to recursion but we use a lookup table before computing solution
            Applied to tabulation (bottom up)
            Builds a table up from base state, and return the last entry in table

        Property2: Optimal substructure
            optimal solution to a state depends on the optimal solution of other states
            Example: shortest path:

    Step2: Decide the state. What is the key to the lookup table?
        State is the set of parameters that can uniquely identify/describe a sub-solution. It is the key to a lookup cache. We want the state to be small (1-2)

        Using the example outlined in step1, you should be able to see which and how each variable changes at each sub-problem.

        In knapsack problem, the state is (index, weight). It can be the state of our answer, like n, in fibinacci.

        If take the memorization approach, the state becomes the key to your memorization AND many be the input to recursive function

        Example: diceTargetSum:
            dp(dice, value, target) =

    Step3: Formulate a relation among the states
        Hardest part of DP

        Since DP is a recurrence and uses sub solutions indexed by the state, how does one solve the general state?
            Example: diceTargetSum:
                dp( dice, value, target) =
                    dp(5, 6, 18) =  dp(4,6,17) + dp(4,6,16) + dp(4,6,15) + dp(4,6,14) + dp(4,6,13) + dp(4,6,12) +
            Example: Given 3 numbers {1, 3, 5}, what is the total number of ways to form a number N?
                Let’s assume we know dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4], dp[5], dp[6]

                what is dp[7]?
                    dp[7] = dp[7-1] + dp[7-3] + dp[7-5]

            Example: longest subsequence of 2 strings (longSubSequence)
            at each recurrence, what are the possible actions (i.e. match or no match)

    Step4: Optimize by adding tabulation or memoization
        Store the subproblem's answer : top down
            coinChange

        Tabulation makes the problem iterative; bottom up.

    Key Points:
        - Model the problem using a graph (adjacency list) and solve it using a graph algorithm (DFS, BFS)

    Graph
        - are great to problems that has structure, and can be modeled the nodes and edges.  The answer to these questions is related on the structure BETWEEN the nodes and edges.
            * Examples: Shortest distance (BFS)
            * Example [optimizations]:

        - Unlike graphs, DP solution at i depends on [i-1, i+1]

        - Implementation:
            * Data model is implemented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrix (see code below)
            * answer to problem is achieved via graph search

    Types of Graph Search
        - General: DFS vs BFS
            * Both have run complexity: O(V + E) ; space complexity: O(V)
            * DFS:
                DIFF: gives discovery time and finishing time
                more intuitive to code since it leverages the call stack

            * BFS
                DIFF: gives distance from vertex; good for shortest distance problems
